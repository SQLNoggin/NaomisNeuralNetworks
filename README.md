# Naomis_DrawingRecogNeuralNetwork 
Hand-Drawn Shapes Neural Network Recognizer
Description

This project aims to develop a neural network that identifies hand-drawn shapes. Users can draw shapes through a GUI, and the neural network predicts the shape they've drawn. It's a great starting point for beginners who are looking to understand neural networks, image processing, and GUI integration.
Features

    Preprocess hand-drawn shapes into a standardized MNIST-like format.
    Train a neural network to recognize these shapes.
    Interactive GUI for users to draw shapes and see predictions.
